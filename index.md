# Hello
I am a freelance developer located in Slovakia, most passionate about realtime 3D graphics rendering and innovative game development technology. I have grown to be an open source fan and believe in sharing with others. I am a huge advocate of Haxe and Kha, which I use to push my work forward.

Feel free to drop me an e-mail(lubos.lenco at me dot com), catch me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/luboslenco) or add me on Skype(lubos.lenco). I am open to any sort of collaboration and love to hear what are you up to!
